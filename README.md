# Code-Along Steps

### Create Front End Login Template
1. `npm i handlebars`
2. Navigate to `views/main.hbs` and notice that the handlebars injection `{{{body}}}` is there, but not much else. 
3. Create a new view called `login.hbs`
4. Add html forms controlled through a tabbing feature to toggle between login and sign up. 
5. Tabbing is handled using CSS, and of course, JavaScript. (NOTE: A basic CSS stylesheet has been provided)

### Create the Login/Sign-Up Logic 
1. Navigate to `public/js/login.js` and add the logic to handle tabbing.
2. While we're at it, we can add event listeners to the forms and the functions that will capture input.
3. Import the script into `login.hbs`

### Create the Post-Login View
1.

### Create the Server:

1. Open server.js
2. Create the base express server:
